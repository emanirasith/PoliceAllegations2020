    "# Summary of Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "#### Question: \n",
    "Are the complaints of women more succesful than men (for the same allegations?)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dataset:\n",
    "command_at_incident: 1544 null values <br>\n",
    "complainant_ethnicity: 4464 null values 1041 'Unknown' <br>\n",
    "complainant_gender: 4195 null values and some 'Not described' <br>\n",
    "complainant_age_incident: 4812 null values <br>\n",
    "allegation: 1 null value <br>\n",
    "precinct: 24 null values <br>\n",
    "contact_reason: 199 null values and some 'No contact' <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "33358 rows x 29 columns  <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row in the dataset is an allegation filed against the police. Each column gives some kind of information about the allegation and if it was successful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cleaning and EDA\n",
    "#### cleaning:\n",
    "First I replaced all values that are \"missing\" to np.NaN. Such as \"Unknown\" in complainant_ethnicity, \"Not described\" in complainant_gender, and \"No contact\" in contact_reason. I did this because these values are equal to np.NaN values and contribute to missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second I removed anyone that was below the age of 0.\n",
    "There should not exist anyone below the age of 0 in this dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Third I chose columns that I deemed relevant to our question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth I located allegations that only came specifically from a \"male\" or \"female\".\n",
    "I decided not to include non-binary genders because they are not part of the population that our question is focused on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fifth I created a success column that quantified if an allegation was a success or not based on the board_disposition.\n",
    "I did this to quantify what success meant for each allegation. \n",
    "\n",
    "*note: in the pre cleaning before I started analyzing, I removed non-binary genders because I am only focused on males and females and that it doesn't affect our analysis because they constituted a very small minority of the total population\n",
    "\n",
    "#### analysis:\n",
    "From just looking at the complainant_gender column, I can see that an overwhelming majority of complaints are filed by men.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the success column, I can see that only around 25% of cases are won against the police. Any substantiated value in 'board_disposition' constitutes a win for the complainant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Men seem to have a higher win rate for cases than women.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment of Missingness\n",
    "I believe that the data is NMAR because the site that I got the data from says that every complaint in the database was heavily investigated and thus the authorities should have identifying information on both the complaining party and the officer(s). The complainants have to provide a sworn statement, so it's hard to assume that the authorities don't know the ethnicity of a complainant when knowing their name gives them access to other avenues to identify them through and thus figure out personal information such as gender and ethnicity. A plausible reason as to why it's missing could be that either the officers or the complainant's would rather not disclose that information\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose to provide a possible explanation for the missingness through the column success. If a case was unsuccessful for the complainant, then the police may choose to withhold putting his or her race down because if he or she is a minority, it could look bad for them if so many cases made by minorities are won in favor of the police.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose complainant_gender to be the column where I expected complainant_ethnicity to not be dependent on it because I don't believe gender to be a reason as to why a complainant's ethnicity cannot be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### sig fig: \n",
    "0.05 to insure accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "#### test statistic:\n",
    "I used tvd (total variation distance) to compare distributions of missingness. I chose tvd because I are dealing with categorical data (complainant_ethnicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### setup:\n",
    "I did not have a setup for the first and last test, but the second test I isolated race allegations from the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### results:\n",
    "pval: 0.009<br>\n",
    "I reject our null hypothesis therefore complaiant_ethnicity's missingness is dependent on success\n",
    "\n",
    "pval: 0.018<br>\n",
    "I reject our null hypothesis, so complainant_ethnicity's missingness is also dependent on success when allegations are about race\n",
    "\n",
    "pval: 0.311<br>\n",
    "I do not reject the null hypothesis, so complainant_ethnicity's missingness is not dependent on complainant_gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypothesis Test\n",
    "#### null hypothesis: \n",
    "In our population, for the same allegations, the successes of men and women have the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### alt hypothesis: \n",
    "In our population, for the same allegations, women are more likely to be successful in their cases than men. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### sig fig: \n",
    "0.01 to insure accuracy \n",
    "\n",
    "#### test statistic: \n",
    "I used diff of means between the proportions of females that win and the proportions of males that win for each individual allegation. Despite gender being categorical I wanted to compare the proportion of the male population vs the female population.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### setup: \n",
    "To choose the allegations that I would like to compare the successes between males and females, I eliminated the allegations where charges were made exclusively by either males or females. Then, I selected the top 10 allegations with the most sample size and among them, I chose the ones that had as close to the same proportion of female representation as in the entire population of males and females.  Since alternate hypothesis concerns women, I wanted the proportion of women in each allegation to be as representative of all of the women in the population as possible. I selected \"Physical force,\" \"Word,\" 'Vehicle stop,\" and \"Threat of force (verbal of physical).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### results: \n",
    "pval:<br>\n",
    "Physical force:                          0.000<br>\n",
    "Therefore for 'Physical force' I reject our null hypothesis meaning that for when allegation type is of 'Physical force' women are more likely to be successful in their case than men\n",
    "\n",
    "Word:                                    0.038<br>\n",
    "Therefore for word I do not reject our null hypothesis meaning that when allegation type is 'word' women and men are equally likely to be successful in their case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vehicle stop:                            0.082<br>\n",
    "Therefore for 'Vehicle stop' I do not reject our null hypothesis meaning that when allegation type is 'Vehicle stop' women and men are equally likely to be successful in their case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threat of force (verbal or physical):    0.792<br>\n",
    "Therefore for 'Threat of force (verbal or physical)' I do not reject our null hypothesis meaning that when allegation type is 'Threat of force (verbal or physical)' women and men are equally likely to be successful in their case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### conclusion:\n",
    "I conclude that when allegations are about 'physical force' women are more likely to have a successful case than men, but for the other three allegations I found that women and men are equally likely to have a successful case. This could be because women are seen to be \"weaker\" than men, so then when they allege 'physical force' they are more likely to be believed than men. Otherwise most allegations seem to be very generally categorized into direct physical contact between the officer and complainant, and non-direct physical (coming into contact with a complainant's belongings, etc.) or verbal actions. \"Word\", \"vehicle stop,\" and \"threat of force (verbal of physical)\" do not involve the police coming into direct physical contact with the complainant (physical threat of force is probably like posturing or brandishing a baton but not actually assaulting the complainant) and thus it seems that women and men are both equally likely to win a case for those allegations. With those allegations, neither men or women seem more \"susceptible.\""
